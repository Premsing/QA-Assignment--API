To summarize, here are the key steps used implement the basic bank system requirements in C#:

Define a BankController class that defines HTTP endpoints to create and delete accounts, and deposit and withdraw money from accounts.
Use a Dictionary to store user accounts in memory, and define an Account class to represent a user's bank account.
Write unit tests to cover all the business rule requirements mentioned above, using a testing framework such as NUnit or xUnit.
Set up the project for local development, using Visual Studio and Docker Compose.
Build and run the application locally using Docker Compose commands, such as docker-compose build and docker-compose up.
By following these steps, you can create a basic bank system in C# that allows users to manage their accounts, deposit and withdraw money, and adhere to business rule requirements. Remember that this is just an example, and you may need to modify the code and configuration to suit your specific needs and requirements.
